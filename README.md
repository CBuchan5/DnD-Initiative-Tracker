# DnD-Initiative-Tracker
A program to assist all Dungeons and Dragons DM’s in keeping track of characters during combat.

This repo has gone through a few changes since being created. Originaly created using Ruby on Rails in an attempt to get familliar with the stack, it was soon returned to MERN to consolidate knowledge gained from the Makers course in a stack I am familliar with. 

## MVP

```
As a DM,
So I know what character is who
I’d like to be able to add a character’s name.

As a DM,
When getting ready for a battle,
I would like to be able to add a character’s initiative.

As a DM,
During combat, so I know whose turn is when,
I would like to order the characters by initiative from highest to lowest. 

```
## Additional options
```
As a DM,
In order to know what characters I am in charge of,
I‘d like the option to select between NPC and PC characters. 

As a DM,
If a character is an NPC,
I would like to add the character’s hit points

As a DM,
If my NPC takes damage
I’d like to subject that damage from their hit points
